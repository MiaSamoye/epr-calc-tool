# Welcome to AQUILA EPR fees estimation tool

**Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR)** is a policy framework that requires producers to take responsibility for the entire lifecycle of their products, especially the post-consumer stage: collection, recycling, or disposal.

We currently offer estimation tools for you to calculate the amount of financial contribution for EPR regulations.

EPR regulations now covers 6 subjects (with its effective date):

- Rechargeable Batteries: 1/1/2024
- Lubricant: 1/1/2024
- Tires and Tubes: 1/1/2024
- Packaging (Commercial): 1/1/2024
- WEEEs (Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment): 1/1/2025
- ELVs (End-of-Life Vehicles): 1/1/2027

#### Recycling Models and Financial Contribution
|                      **Models**                  |        **Steps**                                                                                             |

| **Recycling Organization:** Self-recycling system/ Hire a recycling unit/ Delegate to a PRO | Register (Before March 31st) -> Implement -> Report (Before March 31st, following year)             |
| **Financial Contribution:** Declare and pay to the VEPF          | Declare (Before March 31st) -> First Payment (Before April 20th) -> Second Payment (Before October 20th) |

## EPR Calculator

CBAM Calulator allows you to estimate your financial contribution based on the volume of products/packaging produced from a specific industry.

Financial contribution (F) = R x V x Fs (unit: VND)
- R: Recycling rate (%)
- V: Volume of products/packaging (kg)
- Fs: the reasonable recycling cost per unit of product or packaging (VND/kg)

With Fs = 1.03 x a x (T + Cv + Re) 
- T: Transportation cost (VND/kg)
- Cv: Classification and collection cost (VND/kg)
- Re: Recycling cost (VND/kg)
- a: Adjustment coefficient
- 1.03: Administrative management costs (3% of total recycling costs)
